# dbt_Enterprise_Data_Transformation
This project showcases an end-to-end data engineering and analytics solution for a fictional company, combining data from two different domains: Sales data and the HR employee data. The project leverages the power of dbt (data build tool) for data transformation, Snowflake for data warehousing, and Python to generate transactional data.
